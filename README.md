Yoctoblog
=========

Databaseless Macroblogging Microplatform

Summary
-------

A php/html-only blogging platform for people who don't have access to a database or need the entire blog to be distributable.

The name, "Yoctoblog" is a working name, since it seems there is already another platform called "Yoctoblog" out there.

What Is it?
-----------

The blog is designed to have a very small footprint and be ridiculously easy to implement. After moving the files to the server, Yoctoblog requires just one page refresh to be completely installed. No hassle with databases.

Why?
----

Yoctoblog has many uses:

  * You want a small blog as part of a larger site, and don't want to have to implement a complete content management system like Wordpress.
  * You want a blog on your domain, but your server doesn't provide a database service.
  * You want the entire blog to be portable without any action besides copying the blog directory.
  * You need to have a blog online in the next 2 minutes, or else.

Why Not?
--------

Yoctoblog is not meant for:

  * High-volume or high traffic sites. Refining yoctoblog to work with higher volumes of traffic is one of the future goals, however.
  * Users who want fancy widgets and user management. Yoctoblog is meant to be nothing but a blogging platform.

Are You Done?
-------------

No. Yoctoblog is currently in the alpha stages of development, meaning that it is missing a lot of functionality. Please contribute if you can, or download and test the software (submit bug reports!)

One idea for the future is to compile the PHP code into something like C++ (using Facebook's HipHop?) in order to allow yoctoblog to run on servers without a PHP interpreter.

Thanks!
